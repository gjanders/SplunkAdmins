Introduction
****************
This application accompanies the Splunk conf 2017 presentation "How did you get so big? Tips and tricks for growing your Splunk installation from 50GB/day to 1TB/day"

The overall idea behind this application is to provide a variety of alerts that detect issues or potential issues within the splunk log files and then advise via an alert that this has occurred
This application was built as there were a variety of messages in the Splunk console and logs in Splunk that if acted upon could have prevented an issue within the environment.

The original presentation is available as a recording http://conf.splunk.com/files/2017/recordings/howd-you-get-so-big-tips-n-tricks-for-growing-your-splunk-deployment-from-50-gb-per-day-to-1-tb-per-day.mp4 or PDF http://conf.splunk.com/files/2017/slides/howd-you-get-so-big-tips-tricks-for-growing-your-splunk-deployment-from-50-gb-day-to-1-tb-day.pdf
The powerpoint should it be required is available on https://github.com/gjanders/splunkconf2017

There are many potential alerts that might cause an issue so this application has all alerts disabled by default, post-installation once the required macros are configured you can enable the alerts you wish to use and add the required actions

There are also a few dashboards for investigating indexer performance, heavy forwarder queue usage and data model acceleration issues

Please note that the all alerts & dashboards were tested on Linux-based Splunk infrastructure, with AIX, Linux and Windows forwarders

If you are running your Splunk enterprise installation on Windows or have customised your installation directory you will need to customise some of the macros such as splunkadmins_splunkd_source to point to the correct splunkd log file location

Also note that this application contains a very large number of alerts which you can use, you may wish to utilise the "allow_skew" in savedsearches.conf to allow the scheduler to balance out the scheduled alerts execution times

****************
Macros - required configuration
****************
The various saved searches and dashboards use macros within their searches, you will need to update the macros to ensure the searches/dashboards work as expected
To check the contents of the macros in Splunk 7 or newer, use CTRL-SHFT-E within the search window

The macros are listed below, many expect a host=A OR host=B item to assist in narrowing down a search while others expect only a single value...

indexerhosts - a host=... list of your indexers (for example host=indexer1 OR host=indexer2)

heavyforwarderhosts - a host=... list of your heavy forwarders (for example host=heavyforwarder1 OR host=heavyforwarder2)

searchheadhosts - a host=... list of your search head(s) (for example host=searchhead1 OR host=searchhead2)

localsearchheadhosts - a host=... list of your search head(s) within the cluster that these alerts are running on

splunkenterprisehosts - a host=... list of any Splunk enterprise instance (for example host=indexer1 OR host=searchhead1 OR ...)

deploymentserverhosts - a host=... list of deployment server(s) (for example host=splunkdeploymentserver)

licensemasterhost - a host=... entry for the license master server (for example host=splunklicensemaster)

searchheadsplunkservers - a splunk_server=... list of any Splunk search head hosts (for example splunk_server=searchhead*)

splunkindexerhostsvalue - a splunk_server=... list of any Splunk indexer hosts (for example splunk_server=indexer*)

splunkadmins_splunkd_source - this defaults to source=/opt/splunk/var/log/splunk/splunkd.log, if your splunkd log location is not in this directory please override this macro as appropriate

splunkadmins_splunkuf_source - this defaults to source=*splunkd.log, you may wish to narrow down this location if your splunkd logs on universal forwarders have consistent installation directories 

splunkadmins_mongo_source - this defaults to source=/opt/splunk/var/log/splunk/mongod.log, if your mongodb log file is not in this directory please override this macro as appropriate

splunkadmins_clustermaster_oshost - a host=... entry for the cluster master server (for example host=splunkclustermaster)

The macros are used in various alerts which you can optionally enable, the alerts will raise a triggered alert only as emails are not allowed for Splunk app certification purposes 

The vast majority of the alerts also have a macro(s) which you can customise to tweak the search results, for example the macro `splunkadmins_weekly_truncated` allows the alert, "IndexerLevel - Weekly Truncated Logs Report", to be customised without changing the alert itself. This will make upgrading to a new version of this app more straightforward
I have attempted to provide an appropriate macro in any alert where I deemed it appropriate, feedback is welcome for any alert that you believe should have a macro or requires further improvement

****************
Installation
****************
The application is designed to work on a search head or search head cluster instance, installation on the indexing tier is not required
There are a few searches that use REST API calls which are specific to the search head cluster they run on. These alerts will have to be placed on each search head or search head cluster, alternatively any server with the required search peers will also work, the relevant alerts are:
SearchHeadLevel - Accelerated DataModels with All Time Searching Enabled
SearchHeadLevel - Realtime Scheduled Searches are in use
SearchHeadLevel - Realtime Search Queries in dashboards
SearchHeadLevel - Scheduled Searches without a configured earliest and latest time
SearchHeadLevel - Scheduled searches not specifying an index
SearchHeadLevel - Scheduled searches not specifying an index macro version
SearchHeadLevel - Scheduled Searches Configured with incorrect sharing
SearchHeadLevel - Saved Searches with privileged owners and excessive write perms
SearchHeadLevel - User - Dashboards searching all indexes
SearchHeadLevel - User - Dashboards searching all indexes macro version
SearchHeadLevel - Users exceeding the disk quota (recent jobs list uses a REST call so you may need to adjust the search), the SearchHeadLevel - Users exceeding the disk quota introspection is a non-search head specific alternative

The following reports also are specific to a search head or search head cluster:
SearchHeadLevel - Alerts that have not fired an action in X days
SearchHeadLevel - Data Model Acceleration Completion Status
SearchHeadLevel - Macro report
What Access Do I Have?

The following dashboards are search head or search head cluster specific:
Data Model Rebuild Monitor
Data Model Status

The following reports / alert must either run on the cluster master or a server where the cluster master is a peer:
ClusterMasterLevel - Per index status
ClusterMasterLevel - Primary bucket count per peer

****************
Using the application
****************
Once the application is installed, *all* alerts are disabled by default and you can enable those you require or want to test in your local environment
If you choose not to customise the macros then many searches will search for all hosts, which will make the alerts and dashboards inaccurate!

****************
Which alerts should be enabled?
****************
The alerts are all useful for detecting a variety of different scenarios which may or may not be applicable within your Splunk environment
The description field has an (extremely) simple way of determining if an alert will require action, there are three levels:
  Low - the alert is informational and likely relates to a potential issue, these alerts may produce false alarms
  Moderate - the alert is a warning, most likely further action will need to be taken, a moderate chance of false alarms
  High - the alert is likely relating to something that requires action and there is a very low chance that this will create false alarms

I do not have a nice way to auto-enable various alerts excluding editing the local/savedsearches.conf or via the GUI, any contribution of a setup file would be welcome here!

****************
How is this application used?
****************
In the current environment the vast majority of the alerts are enabled to detect issues, they raise automated tickets or email depending on the urgency of the specific alert.
There are a few environment characteristics that may require changes to the way the app is used, and feedback is welcome if there is a nicer way to structure the alerts/application
The overall assumption is that the admin(s) are not carefully watching the splunkd logs or the messages in the console of the monitoring server/Splunk servers

****************
How is this application tested?
****************
The universal forwarders in use are installed on a mix of Windows, Linux & AIX servers
All heavy forwarders, and Splunk enterprise installations are Linux based, while I expect the alerts will work with only changes to the macros.conf for a Windows based environment this remains untested
The test environment for this application has a single indexer cluster and two search head clusters

****************
Why was this application and associated conf talk created?
****************
Inspired by articles such as "Things I wish I knew then" and knowledge collected from various conference replays, SplunkAnswers, 200+ support tickets & nearly four years of working on a Splunk environment I decided that I would attempt to share what I have learned in an attempt to prevent others from repeating the same mistakes
There are many Splunk conf talks available on this subject in various conference replays, however my goal was to provide practical steps to implement the ideas. That is why this application exists

****************
Which alerts are best suited to automation?
****************
SearchHeadLevel - Scheduled searches not specifying an index
SearchHeadLevel - Scheduled Searches Configured with incorrect sharing
SearchHeadLevel - Splunk login attempts from users that do not have any LDAP roles
SearchHeadLevel - Scheduled Searches That Cannot Run
SearchHeadLevel - Scheduled Searches without a configured earliest and latest time
SearchHeadLevel - Users exceeding the disk quota
SearchHeadLevel - User - Dashboards searching all indexes

Are all well suited to an automated email using the sendresults command or a similar function as they involve end user configuration which the individual can change/fix

****************
Custom search commands
****************
Due to the current SPL not handling a particular task well, and the lookup commands not supporting regular expressions, I found that the only workable solution was to create a custom lookup command.

Two exist:
streamfilter - based on a single (or multivalue) field name, and a single (or multivalue) field with patterns, apply the regular expression in the pattern field against the nominated field(s)
streamfilterwildcard - identical to streamfilter except that this takes a field name with wildcards, and assumes an index-style expression, so * becomes (?i)^[^_].*$, and example* becomes (?i)^example.*$

Search help is available and these are used within the reports in this application. The Splunk python SDK version 1.6.5 is also included as this is required as part of the app, an example from the reports is:
| streamfilterwildcard pattern=indexes fieldname=indexes srchIndexesAllowed

Where indexes is a field name containing a list of wildcards (_int*, _aud*) or similar, indexes is the output field name, srchIndexesAllowed is the field name which the indexes field will be compared to.
Each entry in the pattern field will be compared to each entry in the srchIndexesAllowed field in this example

****************
KVStore Usage
****************
Some CSV lookups are now replaced with kvstore entries due to the ability to sync the kvstore across multiple search head or search head cluster(s) via apps like TA-SyncKVStore https://splunkbase.splunk.com/app/3519/

****************
Feedback?
****************
Feel free to open an issue on github or use the contact author on the SplunkBase link and I will try to get back to you when possible, thanks!
